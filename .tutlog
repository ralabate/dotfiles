The easiest way to do liquids in Houdini! 19.5 FLIP SOP Solver (Yonni de Haar)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBspZVCSv9Y

+ Very short and concise
+ Learned about ground plane in FLIP Solver SOP
- Some subtle technical errors re: confusing meshing and SDF representation

How to Simulate a Small Fountain (Mark Spevick)
https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/how-to-simulate-a-small-fountain/

+ Shows how to use the output of one FLIP sim as the input to another FLIP sim using FLIP Boundary SOP
+ Shows how to merge the output of two FLIP sims using VDBCombine SOP
+ Learned about Gas Stick on Collision DOP
+ Learned about indirect path guiding (preconstructed indirect diffuse approximation, just a checkbox)
- Extremely long and drawn out
- Absurd sim times, six substeps and 1.5 grid scale at 2 millimeters
- TOPs chapter requires external download for ImageMagick TOP
- TOPs chapter requires hacking LD_PRELOAD for OpenGL TOP (on CentOS 7)

Whitewater System (Omar Zarifi)
https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-17-masterclass-whitewater-system/

+ Incredible, best elaboration of the whitewater documentation I have watched
+ Easy to follow explanations of sourcing and render prep (vary desnity by both age and depth), ok coverage of solver forces
+ DIY mist solver at the end is worth the price of admission (just four nodes! Group, drag, noise, deathchance...)
+ Great hip file, learned about "Accumulated" mode for Volume Rasterize Attributes SOP, looks better than the default
- Doesn't go into the details of colliders, which I think are only used for adhesion forces
- Doesn't go into PBF tech underlying foam forces
- Doesn't discuss custom repulsion shapes
- Discusses both Whitewater Scale parameter and Emission Amount parameter but doesn't go into differences (scatter mult + physics vs. just scatter mult)
- Spends a little too much time on the FLIP portion of the examples instead of dedicating all of the time to whitewater
- Only discusses rendering whitewater as volumes, not points or meshes

Water & Ocean Rendering Using Houdini and Karma (Saber Jlassi)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN0SbcReOek

+ Basic overview of what shelf oceans should look like rendered
+ Inspired me to learn more about the dicing process: shading quality of 1 means 1 micropolygon per pixel, can go less than one for speed
+ Inspired me to learn more about the dicing process: dicing flatness influences how refined "nearly flat" polygons get
+ Apparently Karma doesn't have any kind of new way (transmission scatter a la prman/arnold/3dl) of doing water interiors, they are using old-school method of rendering interior of ocean as volume
+ Have never thought about hiding ocean volume from primary ray, wonder why they do that...
+ Learned about blocking values with Properites Edit LOP
+ Learned basics of setting up Cryptomatte in Solaris
- Doesn't talk at all about why you would use which whitewater rendering method; offline rasterization, points as discs, points as oriented discs, points as spheres and points as online rasterized
- Doesn't discuss the foam workflow in the ocean shader
- Doesn't really talk about water or what it should look like or references or anything, more a video about Karma nodes than anything else

Bubbles Again: Simulating Soap Swirls Using FLIP (Moritz Schwind)

Bubbles Again: VEX Thinfilm Shader in Mantra (Moritz Schwind)
+ Cool use of specular color
+ Parenting backdrop to camera is the jam
- Not so much a tutorial, as an explanation of porting an OSL shader to VEX
- Uses OG ubershader, having a hard time porting it to PBR Non-Metallic VOP (reflections seem to stay white)
- Downloadable project was missing key ingredient, thin film thickness texture
