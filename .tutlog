The easiest way to do liquids in Houdini! 19.5 FLIP SOP Solver (Yonni de Haar)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBspZVCSv9Y

+ Very short and concise
+ Learned about ground plane in FLIP Solver SOP
- Some subtle technical errors re: confusing meshing and SDF representation

How to Simulate a Small Fountain (Mark Spevick)
https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/how-to-simulate-a-small-fountain/

+ Shows how to use the output of one FLIP sim as the input to another FLIP sim using FLIP Boundary SOP
+ Shows how to merge the output of two FLIP sims using VDBCombine SOP
+ Learned about Gas Stick on Collision DOP
+ Learned about indirect path guiding (preconstructed indirect diffuse approximation, just a checkbox)
- Extremely long and drawn out
- Absurd sim times, six substeps and 1.5 grid scale at 2 millimeters
- TOPs chapter requires external download for ImageMagick TOP
- TOPs chapter requires hacking LD_PRELOAD for OpenGL TOP (on CentOS 7)

Whitewater System (Omar Zarifi)
https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-17-masterclass-whitewater-system/

+ Incredible, best elaboration of the whitewater documentation I have watched
+ Easy to follow explanations of sourcing and render prep (vary desnity by both age and depth), ok coverage of solver forces
+ DIY mist solver at the end is worth the price of admission (just four nodes! Group, drag, noise, deathchance...)
+ Great hip file, learned about "Accumulated" mode for Volume Rasterize Attributes SOP, looks better than the default
- Doesn't go into the details of colliders, which I think are only used for adhesion forces
- Doesn't go into PBF tech underlying foam forces
- Doesn't discuss custom repulsion shapes
- Discusses both Whitewater Scale parameter and Emission Amount parameter but doesn't go into differences (scatter mult + physics vs. just scatter mult)
- Spends a little too much time on the FLIP portion of the examples instead of dedicating all of the time to whitewater
- Only discusses rendering whitewater as volumes, not points or meshes
